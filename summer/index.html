        <h2>Volunteering</h2>
        <p>
          My trip to Peru, Cusco was very meaningful and truly helped me inquire many
          enriching experiences that will stay with me forever. In the first week, I
          did the Construction and Renovation Project. I with other volunteers built
          shelter for homeless dogs, and built a health center for local nearby community.

          During the second week, I visited Machu Picchu. I hiked halfway through the
          top and obtained an excellent panoramic view of Machu Picchu. Even though I
          was very tired from everything, it was all worth it at the end. Additionally,
          the llamas there were friendly to tourists; when you would walk closer to
          them, they were happy to take pictures with tourists.
